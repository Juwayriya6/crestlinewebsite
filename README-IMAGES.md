# Crestline Website Images
Ready-to-upload images + hero snippets.

## Where to copy
- Copy the entire `assets/` folder into your repo root (it will place images in `assets/images/...`)
- Append `hero-image.css` into `assets/css/crestline-overrides.css` (or include it as a separate file after main.css)
- Replace your current hero block in `index.html` with `hero-image.html`

## Logo
- Use `assets/images/logo/crestline-logo-512.png` in your header, and `assets/images/logo/favicon.ico` for the browser tab.
